📄 # NLP-Resume-Intelligence-System
An AI-powered resume analysis tool built with Python and NLP techniques. Extracts key skills, identifies gaps, and delivers actionable insights for talent evaluation and career development.

🚀 Overview

NLP-Resume-Intelligence-System is an intelligent resume analysis tool designed to extract skills, identify missing competencies, and generate actionable insights for career development and talent evaluation.

This project is built as a structured learning journey—progressing from basic NLP techniques to more advanced AI components such as embeddings, semantic similarity, and ML-driven recommendations.
It also serves as a professional portfolio project demonstrating mastery of Python, NLP, and version control workflows.

✨ Features
Current Features (Phase 1 – Foundational NLP)

Text reading and preprocessing

Lowercasing, punctuation removal, and tokenization

Word frequency analysis

Stopword filtering
